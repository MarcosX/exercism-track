# Tracking exercises for [exercism.io](http://exercism.io)

Currently working on: [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org)

## Local development

Use the `Makefile` to run all tests for all languages or use the language specific tasks if you wanna run just a sigle language.

## Developing with Docker

Use the `Dockerfile` attached to run a Ubuntu container with all languages installed.
Run `docker build -t marcosx/exercism.io .` to build the image and then `docker run --name exercism.io_instance -it marcosx/exercism.io` to run all tests.

## Languages on hold

Scala
